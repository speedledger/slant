# Slant

This is a simple wrapper for ant-design that overrides some of the styling.

This project requires `node 8` and `npm 5`.

## Scripts

* `npm run clean` - removes `dist` and `lib` folders
* `npm run build` - copies our `src` and ant-design `dist` into combined `dist` and `lib` folders.
* `npm run example` - runs `build` and then starts a devserver with HMR on http://localhost:3000 with the example docs.
